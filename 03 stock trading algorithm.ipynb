    "It's a good idea to pick stocks which appear to have negative co-movements. Translation: pick bullish and bearish stocks. The market buys into Tesla on optimistic days when capital is moving into the index. Kroger, on the other hand, appears more a fallout shelter stock. People buy in when the market is down. Or maybe because the retail grocery is beaten down at the time of this writing, fewer are selling out of their positions.\n",
